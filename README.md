This is a final project at Grand Circus to solidify everything we have learned. 
This web application is designed for users who enjoy meeting and/or working in coffee shops but would like to know specific information conducive for getting work done at that location. The user can login, create an account and view shops in the area with the unique data. The user may also add their own shop and submit reviews on existing shops.
This application uses the SpringMVC framework. The client request is sent to the specified controller and in most cases is processed using the DAO methods using Hibernate. The application also makes heavy use of GooglePlaces API and Google maps API.
Tech skills used for this project: Java, JSP, JSTL, SpringMVC, Hibernate, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JSON.
